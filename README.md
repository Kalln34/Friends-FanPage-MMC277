# Friends-FanPage-MMC277
Challenges: 
- creation and merging branches within a group setting
- handful of technical challenges with merging code and having each group member see the same results (i.e. 2 group members unable to see a background image while the other two can see it just fine) - NOTE: this was resolved as we needed to change the file name, but still left confused since we don't know how the file name was changed.
- Commiting changes. Ran into various errors (fatal not concluded merge, commit changes before merge, untracked working tree files needing to be overwritten). We did however, work through these issues to get to the final result.
- Configuring the proper sizing for images for mobile, specifially the Friends logo. The group attemepted numerous times to resize and Lightouse still found an issue. 



Index.html file: all group members participated in the creation of the landing page 

CSS style sheet: 
    Kat coded the css infrasturcure for each page of the site. Each group member added css code to their individual pages. Victoria and Kat refined the landing page CSS and the Matthew Perry CSS throughout the project

Pages: 
    - Main Cast = Victoria 
    - Recurring Characters = Kat
    - Iconic Scenes = Kendra
    - Matthew Perry Tribute = Chelsea
    NOTE: Matthew Perry tribute page did not require as much information, therefore did not require a large number of commits. 

Site mock up and style guide was created by Chelsea, but the group went over/decided the mock up and color scheme together
