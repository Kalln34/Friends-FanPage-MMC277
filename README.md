Challenges: 
- creation and merging branches within a group setting
- handful of technical challenges with merging code and having each group member see the same results (i.e. 2 group members unable to see a background image while the other two can see it just fine)
- Commiting changes. Ran into various errors (fatal not concluded merge, commit changes before merge, untracked working tree files needing to be overwritten) 



Index.html file: all group members participated in the creation of the landing page 
Style sheet: Kat created the bulk of the baseline of the coding, each group member added css code to their individual pages
