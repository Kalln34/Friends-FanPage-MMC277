                <p>Matthew Perry was the laughing heart throughout ten seasons of television history. Could he
                    be any funnier? Bringing the most comical character moments into our lives through his
                    unforgettable portrayal of Chandler Bing—a character whose sarcastic wit, awkward charm,
                    and loyal heart made him one of television’s most beloved. Beyond the screen, Matthew’s
                    openness about his struggles with the big terrible thing showed us a different kind of courage
                    and inspired many of us to keep going, even in their darkest moments. His humor was a gift,
                    his honesty a light, and his legacy will forever live on in the smiles he gave the world. Thank
                    you, Matthew, for being a friend to us all. Everyone knows that a true friend will always be
                    there for you. <br>
                    Love, <br>
                    Your Fans.
