                <p>Rachel Green</p>
                <p>Rachel starts as a runaway bride in the big city with no clue how to survive without Daddy’s credit card. Throughout the series, she transforms from a spoiled fashion novice into a confident and booming woman in the fashion industry. With her iconic hairstyles and hilarious moments, Rachel is the heart of many love stories — especially her on-again, off-again romance with Ross. He did say her name at his wedding, after all.</p>

                <p>Monica is an obsessive-compulsive chef with a competitive streak and a giant heart. As the group’s mom, her apartment is the gang’s home base. Her transformation from the “unnoticed younger sibling” to a confident woman in love with Chandler is one of the show’s most touching arcs. Watch out — she’s a clean freak and plays to win!</p>

                <p>Phoebe Buffay</p>
                <p>Phoebe is the quirky, unpredictable, and spiritually inclined masseuse with a unique musical style — who could forget “Smelly Cat”? Behind her eccentric surface lies a tough survivor with a dark past and an endless well of love and wisdom. She brings magic, mystery, and moonlight to the group.</p>

                <p>Joey Tribbiani</p>
                <p>Joey is an aspiring actor and food-loving friend with a heart of gold. His loyalty and simple charm make him endearing, even when hilariously clueless. He’s best known for his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of Our Lives, his undying love for sandwiches, and, of course: “How you doin’?”</p>

                <p>Chandler Bing</p>
                <p>Chandler is the king of sarcasm and quick-witted one-liners. Though he hides his emotional side behind humor, his evolution into a devoted husband and adoptive father is deeply moving. Whether he’s talking about “his job no one understands” or poking fun at Joey, Chandler brings heart and hilarity to every scene. Could he be any more lovable?... Yes. He can.</p>

                <p>Ross Geller</p>
                <p>Oh Ross, the lovable paleontologist with a passion for dinosaurs and a talent for awkward situations, is Monica’s older brother and the most intellectual of the group. Known for his three divorces, his eternal love for Rachel, and the unforgettable “We were on a break!” saga, Ross blends geeky charm with emotional vulnerability.</p>
