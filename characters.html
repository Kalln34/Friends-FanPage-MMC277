                    While Friends is beloved for its six main characters, the show wouldn’t be the same without its unforgettable recurring cast. Whether it’s a lovesick barista, a nasal-voiced ex, or a suave optometrist, these characters brought extra humor, heart, and drama to the series. Here, we celebrate three of the most memorable recurring characters—Gunther, Janice, and Richard—who each left a lasting impression on both the gang and fans alike.

                        <p class="description"> The barista with his signature platinum hair and quiet longing, Gunther worked tirelessly behind the counter at Central Perk. Though he mostly lingered in the background, his unspoken love for Rachel gave us countless subtle (and not-so-subtle) comedic moments. From his deadpan sarcasm to his shock when Ross kisses Rachel, Gunther becomes an unexpected fan favorite. Whether steaming lattes or daydreaming about Rachel, he was the ever-present witness to the gang’s lives.</p>

On-again, off-again with Chandler, she’d pop up at the most unexpected (and often inconvenient) times — sometimes dating, sometimes married, but always one of a kind. Her over-the-top personality clashed hilariously with the group’s reactions whenever she showed up.</p>
